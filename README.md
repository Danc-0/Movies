# Movies
An Android app am using [The TMDB API ](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to display Movies. Am building it with with clean architecture principles, Repository and MVVM with JetPack Compose Libraries.
Its a work in progress trying to implement all the related libraries on Android using Kotlin and working with the best architecture.

The Libraries am using in the Development of the whole Application.

* [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)üöÄ
* [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - support library that allows binding of UI components in layouts to data sources,binds character details and search results to UI.
